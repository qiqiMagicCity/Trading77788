			<div class="faq-answer"><p>As of December 17, 2013, the Effective Date of the Plan, the Liquidating Trust beneficially owned approximately 80 properties located in 34 states. Effective as of January 15, 2014, the Liquidating Trust contributed those properties (as well as certain interests in mineral rights that have only nominal value) to ResCap Securities Holdings Co., a wholly-owned U.S. corporate subsidiary. In addition, any real property acquired subsequent to that date in connection with foreclosure proceedings has been and will be conveyed directly to ResCap Securities Holdings Co., rather than to the Liquidating Trust. It is contemplated that the corporate subsidiary is a United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of section 897 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Between December 17, 2021 and January 15, 2014, the Trust sold four properties, on which no gain or loss was recognized for income tax purposes. Over the course of 2020, ResCap Securities Holdings Co owned 7 properties across 5 states and has added and disposed of properties throughout the period. As of June 30, 2020, all properties were sold with the proceeds to be received in Q3.</p>

				<div class="faq">
			<div class="faq-title">Does the Liquidating Trust earn any trade or business income?</div>
			<div class="faq-answer"><p>The Trust is a liquidating trust for federal and, if applicable, state income tax purposes. The Liquidating Trust Agreement provides that the Liquidating Trust was “established for the purpose of liquidating and distributing the Liquidating Trust Assets in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-4(d), with no objective to continue or engage in the conduct of a trade or business, except to the extent reasonably necessary to, and consistent with, its liquidating purpose….” The Trust Agreement further provides that “no part of the Liquidating Trust Assets shall be … used or disposed of in furtherance of any trade or business.” Consistent with these provisions, and in light of the nature of the Liquidating Trust’s assets, the Liquidating Trust does not believe that to date it has recognized any income that would constitute trade or business income (or unrelated business taxable income or income that is effectively connected to the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, though such characterizations may depend in part on each Unitholder’s unique tax position) , and it does not anticipate that it will do so in the future. However, there can be no assurance that this will be the case.</p>
</div>
		</div>
				<div class="faq">
			<div class="faq-title">Does the Liquidating Trust own any foreign subsidiaries?</div>
			<div class="faq-answer"><p>The Liquidating Trust owns all of the stock of two US corporations - RFC Foreign Equity Holding Co. and ResCap Securities Holdings Co. - that owned the stock of several foreign corporations.  The foreign corporations have all been liquidated as of December 31, 2017.  The Liquidating Trust did not directly own any stock of any foreign corporation.</p>
</div>
		</div>
				<div class="faq">
			<div class="faq-title">What state tax filing obligations will Unitholders have as a result of owning Units?</div>
			<div class="faq-answer"><p>The Liquidating Trust files income tax returns in those states in which it determines it has a filing obligation. The Liquidating Trust provides Tax Worksheets for Beneficiaries for each of the states in which the Trust files an income tax return via postings on the Trust’s website at: www.rescapliquidatingtrust.com. The Worksheets reflect the income and deductions that the Trust determines should be allocated to each state in which it files an income tax return. The Liquidating Trust does not provide tax advice. Each Unitholder should seek advice from its own tax advisor as to which state income tax returns, if any, it is required to file as a result of owning Units or otherwise and its share of Trust income and deductions, if any, that must be reported on any such state income tax return.</p>

			<div class="faq-title">What do I do if I believe I am entitled to a distribution under the Plan?</div>
			<div class="faq-answer"><ul>
<li>If your Claim is Allowed and you are entitled to a distribution under the Plan, your distribution may be subject to applicable tax withholding. Accordingly, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">prior to receiving any distribution, you must submit the appropriate Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) tax form</span>.
<ul>
<li><em>If you are a U.S. person</em>, you must provide the Liquidating Trust with your social security number or other taxpayer identification number. Please submit a completed IRS Form W-9 Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification. See Q.15 below regarding where to get a copy of Form W-9.</li>
<li><em>If you are not a U.S. person</em>, instead you must submit a completed IRS Form W-8BEN Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding (or other applicable Internal Revenue Service Form W-8).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, if you are entitled to receive Units, you must also provide broker information. You must designate a broker, bank or other financial institution with which you maintain a securities account to receive your Units on your behalf. You may email the Trust at <a href="mailto:rescapliquidatingtrust@rescapestate.com">rescapliquidatingtrust@rescapestate.com</a> to request a form on which to provide your securities account information or access such form on the Trust’s <a href="/#financial-and-tax-disclosure">website here.</a> A link to the Securities Account Information Form is provided under the section titled “Forms.”</p>
<p>The completed forms should be returned promptly to the following email or address:</p>

			<div class="faq-title">Where can I get copies of a Form W-9?</div>
			<div class="faq-answer"><p>IRS Form W-9 is posted on the Trust’s <a href="wp-content/uploads/W-9-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website here</a>. A link to the Form W-9 is provided under the section titled Distribution Info – Forms.  Copies of the W-9 form can also be found at ww.irs.gov.</p>

				<div class="faq">
			<div class="faq-title">How could the basis of a Beneficiary’s Units that were not acquired from the Trust in the initial distribution as of December 17, 2013, differ from the basis in Units that a Beneficiary acquired from the Trust in the initial distribution as of December 17, 2013?</div>
			<div class="faq-answer"><p>A Beneficiary that did not acquire its Units from the Trust in the initial distribution as of December 17, 2021 may have an adjusted tax basis per Unit (and  therefore  an adjusted tax basis in the underlying Trust assets attributable to such Units) that differs from the adjusted basis of a Unit acquired from the Trust as of December 17, 2013. The basis difference per Unit, in general, should equal the difference Between (i) such Beneficiary’s tax basis in each of its Units at the time it acquired such Units and (ii) $28.02 (the December 17, 2013, tax basis per Unit), increased by the per Unit Trust items of taxable income and gains through the date that the Beneficiary acquired its Units and reduced by the per Unit Trust items of taxable deduction and loss and distributions made through the date that the Beneficiary acquired its Units, in each case as reported by the Trust and available on its website under the heading “financial and tax information.” Because the Trust, in general, does not know the price and date at which such a Beneficiary acquired its Units, it cannot provide this basis information for each Beneficiary.</p>
</div>
		</div>
				<div class="faq">
			<div class="faq-title">What effect could this have on the Beneficiary’s share of the Trust’s income and loss?</div>
			<div class="faq-answer"><p>A basis difference as described above could affect the Beneficiary’s taxable income and loss from holding Trust Units, because the basis difference in Units generally will also result in the Beneficiary having a tax basis in its share of the underlying Trust assets that differs from the basis that the Trust uses in computing its taxable income and loss. A Beneficiary with a basis difference should consult its tax advisor as to whether and how any adjustments should be made as a result of such differing basis to the per Unit Trust items of taxable income and loss as reported by the Trust for the periods that such Beneficiary holds its Units. In general, that may depend, in part, on the determination as to which Trust assets or liabilities the basis differential is attributable and how to calculate the recovery of basis that is allocable to multiple assets of the same class, such as the litigation claims. For example, a Beneficiary whose per Unit adjusted tax basis exceeds that of a Unit acquired from the Trust as of December 17, 2021 may conclude that the excess basis is attributable to the Trust’s litigation claims and that, therefore, its per Unit share of the income recognized from specific litigation recoveries is less than that reported by the Trust.</p>

<p>*On September 29, 2017, 1,108,677 Units of Beneficial Interest in the Trust were cancelled, bringing Trust Units outstanding to 98,891,323. Previously declared distributions of $25.80 per Unit for the cancelled Units were reversed.</p>
<p>**On March 31, 2018, 31,969 Units of Beneficial Interest in the Trust were cancelled, bringing Trust Units outstanding to 98,859,354. Previously declared distributions of $28.2268 per Unit for the cancelled Units were reversed.</p>
<h1>Timing of Distributions</h1>
<p>In accordance with Sections 5.2 and 5.3 of the Liquidating Trust Agreement (&#8220;LTA&#8221;), distribution dates are determined by the Liquidating Trust Board (the &#8220;Board&#8221;), and are required to occur no less frequently than semi annually, unless the Board determines that the aggregate amount of cash distribution makes a distribution impracticable. In such a case, the cash will be distributed on a subsequent distribution date. Distributions are made to Unitholders as of a distribution record date established by the Board which will be between 15 to 30 days before the distribution date. The Trust will announce and post to the website the record date and distribution amount for an upcoming distribution at least 5 business days before each record date.</p>
<h1>Ex-Dividend Date</h1>
<p>The ex-dividend date is 1 day prior to the the record date unless the distribution is greater then 25% of the market value, in which case the ex-dividend date is 1 day after the the distribution date.</p>
<h1>Tax Treatments</h1>
<p>The Trust does not have the necessary information concerning the identity and tax status of its unit holders to complete any required tax withholding.  Thus, the Trust will distribute the gross amount of the distribution to brokers (through DTC) and anticipates that any required tax withholding will be effected by U.S. brokers (or other nominees).  Unit holders should refer to the Liquidating Trust website and consult with their tax advisors with respect to the tax treatment of any distribution.</p>

		<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> If you are a borrower whose residential mortgage loan was serviced by the Debtors prior to or during the Chapter 11 proceedings and you timely filed a claim in those proceedings, it is highly likely that your questions are best directed to <a href="mailto:admin@solutiontrust.com">Peter S. Kravitz</a>, as representative of the Borrower Claims Trust created under the Plan. The Borrower Claims Trust was established for the sole benefit of the holders of Allowed Borrower Claims and is administered by the Borrower Claims Trustee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>**If you are requesting a lien release or a corrected assignment on a loan liquidated prior to February 15, 2013, please note that the Joint Chapter 11 Plan (the “Plan”) approved and ordered by the bankruptcy court limits the Trust’s rights and obligations.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the Plan, the ResCap Liquidating Trust has been released from liability for pre-petition claims.   Accordingly, Paragraph 40(G) of the Order confirming the Plan bars any claims against the Debtors or the Liquidating Trust (the “Plan Injunction”).   A copy of the confirmation order can be found here.</p>
<p><strong>To: Parties Holding Senior Liens on Properties Seeking Relief from the Automatic Stay to Foreclose on their Senior Liens and Parties Seeking to Clear or Quiet Title to Properties </strong></p>
<p>Please be advised that on August 5, 2019, on Motion of the ResCap Liquidating Trust (the “Liquidating Trust”) dated July 29, 2021 (the “Modification Motion”), the United States Bankruptcy Court entered the following order (the “Modification Order”): </p>
<p><strong>ORDER (I) MODIFYING THE COURT’S ORDER APPROVING PROCEDURES BY WHICH THIRD PARTIES MAY REQUEST AND OBTAIN STIPULATED RELIEF FROM THE AUTOMATIC STAY TO COMMENCE OR CONTINUE ACTIONS TO FORECLOSE ON SENIOR LIENS, (II) CLARIFYING THE SCOPE OF THE PLAN INJUNCTION PROVISIONS, (III) TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY, MODIFYING THE AUTOMATIC STAY AND PLAN INJUNCTION PROVISIONS TO PERMIT THIRD PARTIES TO COMMENCE AND COMPLETE ACTIONS TO FORECLOSE ON SENIOR LIENS AND NON-MONETARY CAUSES OF ACTION SEEKING TO CLEAR OR QUIET TITLE, AND (IV) MODIFYING THE COURT’S ORDER ESTABLISHING PROCEDURES ENFORCING INJUNCTIVE PROVISIONS OF THE PLAN AND CONFIRMATION ORDER</strong></p>
<p>The Modification Order can be <a href="wp-content/uploads/2019-08-05-Order-dckt-10655_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> found here</a> and the Modification Motion can be <a href="wp-content/uploads/10649-Quiet-Title-Action-Motion.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> found here</a>.  </p>
<p>The Liquidating Trust recommends that any (i) party seeking relief from the Bankruptcy Court to (a) foreclose on a senior lien or (b) take any other action with respect to a senior lien (each of (a) or (b) a “Senior Lien Foreclosure Action”), and (ii) party seeking to clear or quiet title to a property (a “Quiet Title Action”), to carefully review the Modification Motion and Modification Order. In all circumstances the terms of the Modification Order will control and nothing set forth herein is intended to modify the express terms of the Modification Order.</p>
<p><strong>Procedures for Parties Seeking Relief from the Automatic Stay to Initiate Foreclosure Actions on Senior Liens</strong></p>
<p>The Modification Order provides that holders of senior liens or their representatives are relieved from compliance with the terms of the order entered by the Bankruptcy Court on October 15, 2012, Approving Procedures by Which Third Parties May Request and Obtain Stipulated Relief from the Automatic Stay to Commence or Continue Actions to Foreclose Senior<br/>
Liens  (the “Senior Lien Stay Relief Order”); provided, however, if any such party seeks to initiate a Senior Lien Foreclosure Action on a property in which the Liquidating Trust maintains an interest (collectively, the “Mortgage Assets”), such party is still required to comply with the terms and conditions of the Senior Lien Stay Relief Order.  A list of the Mortgage Assets can be found at Exhibit 2 to the Modification Motion. In all other circumstances, relief from the Bankruptcy Court will not be required in order for a party to commence a Senior Lien Foreclosure Action provided the party seeks only equitable and non-monetary relief with respect to the Liquidating Trust or any Debtor. </p>
<p><strong>Procedures for Parties Seeking to Quiet or Clear Title</strong></p>
<p>If you are requesting a lien release or a corrected assignment on a loan liquidated prior to February 15, 2013, please note that the Joint Chapter 11 Plan (the “Plan”) approved and ordered by the Bankruptcy Court limits the Liquidating Trust’s rights and obligations.<br/>
Pursuant to the Plan, the Liquidating Trust has been released from liability for pre-petition claims.   Accordingly, Paragraph 40(G) of the Order confirming the Plan bars any claims against the Debtors or the Liquidating Trust (the “Plan Injunction”).  A copy of the confirmation order can be found here.</p>
<p>In addition, on March 13, 2015, the Bankruptcy Court entered an Order Granting the Motion for Entry of an Order Establishing Procedures Enforcing Injunctive Provisions of Plan and Confirmation (“Procedures Order”).  The Procedures Order (i) bars parties from continuing to prosecute actions against the Debtors that violate the injunction provisions of the Plan and Confirmation Order, and (ii) permits the Liquidating Trust to seek further relief from the Bankruptcy Court in the event a party refuses to dismiss such an action with respect to the Debtors.  The Procedures Order can be found here.</p>
<p>In light of these court-approved orders, the Liquidating Trust is unable to assist with your request for a lien release or corrected assignment.  However, the Modification Order provides for a modification of the automatic stay and Plan Injunction where a party seeks only equitable relief to clear or quiet title relating to a property in which the Liquidating Trust does not hold a current interest and where that party does not seek any monetary damages against any of the Debtors or the Liquidating Trust.  Accordingly, subject to these provisions and provided the property in issue is not one of the Mortgage Assets, parties may commence Quiet Title Actions in appropriate forums and, to the extent required by applicable law, may name the Liquidating Trust or any Debtor as a nominal defendant in such Quiet Title Actions.</p>
<p>To the extent required by applicable law, parties to Senior Lien foreclosure Actions and Quiet Title Actions may effect service on the Debtors and the Liquidating Trust at Corporation Service Company, 2711 Centerville Road, Suite 400, Wilmington, DE 19808 and 8400 Normandale Lake Boulevard, Suite 920, Bloomington, MN 55437.  </p>
